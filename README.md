# The Py's Shitter ("El Caganer del Py")

In my country, each year, at Christmas we have a tradition.  Several villages organise at night live nativity scenes in which the local residents take part. A funny scene is "El Caganer" (literally means "the crapper" or "the shitter").

The purpose of this project is to do a funnier escene with with Raspberry Pi, a ultrasonic sensor and Python.
